    "My son had been in a special needs school for two years of his basic school level life and we could barely see any difference. He is dyslexic and was diagnosed with ADHD. My husband was already tired of trying. At 11 years we decided to enroll him in a mainstream school and the school administration insist we see a professional and referred us to Energace. An assessment was done and therapy started. My son who could barely read his two sound words reading age was increased by 5 years in the space of 3 months. The cognitive training he was using helped with his attention, concentration and much more. They even had this Brainware therapy for his hyperactivity which was so effective. It has one year long but I am very grateful. We miss you oh. We are happy he can still continue with the brain training and work with the therapist at home.",
    "All I can say is that ever since I started attending energace for therapy I have been at peace with myself… We all need someone to talk to and who better to feel that role? None other than my psychologist Ms Loveth Ezeh, she is patient and accommodative to listen to what ever you have to say. The only difference is that you have to pay for it… But still on the matter I have seen a tremendous change in my life, marriage and finances ever since I started my sessions with her. Can plan well and organize my activities of the day with ease now and feel very much in control of my life and emotions. I have only had 3 sticks of cigarettes since last week. I am seeing myself quite anytime soon. Thank you so much ma and may God continually bless and enrich you…with love.",
    "Visiting Energace opened doors for me. I was suffering from many things, emotionally that I couldn't name and found myself getting stuck in rut after rut. I was torn between resigning to an hermit's life or one of violence. I summoned the of my last guts and booked sessions. I can assure you that every song from the first session to the last, was one of victory. They helped me discover parts of myself I had hitherto buried deep; as the lead psychologist would often say, 'we don't just help you, we help you learn how to help yourself. Every dime I spent here was more than worth.'",
    "My son was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD. He was a happy children but lacked self-confidence and was unable to focus and some of the exercises in this Programme focused on this. He has more self confidence and longer attention span. While my daughter struggled as a reader, picks a book and can’t go beyond a page, now she can read a book from the beginning to the end and can challenge herself across board. Then myself, I started using the programme first. Realized I would read something and have to read the same page severally, now I read once and can retain the information. I am more patient, pay attention and stay focused.",
    "As a psychologist, taking a detour into clinical cognitive expertise was one of the wisest decisions I have ever made. My research led into discovering that the brain can be exercised just as the human body can be. I personally use to struggle with my perception of directions, forgetfulness of tiny details (like where I left my phone, e.t.c.) I have used our Cognitive Training Programme for 6 years and I now sit and mentally remember these things without having to stand and move around. Interestingly all my other cognitive skills keeps getting stronger and better.",
    "I just really want to say a big thank for our online sessions. It really made opening up really easy for me, I was able to say all without holding back and that has really helped me see and think clearly with your help and prevented me from making a huge mistake and also love myself more . I think everyone should be open to doing this more often,you can't always have it all figured out and its ok to seek professional help to help make proper decisions"
