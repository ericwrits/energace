Statistics shows that over 32 million people in Nigeria struggle with reading, spelling or dictation and comprehension, with a lot of people having dyslexia symptoms. An example will be the case of an outright misinterpretation of a comprehension passage, phonics, composition or all kinds of essays as a result of not understanding the importance of planning, simultaneous processing, attention and sequential processing in literacy activities. We have two basic therapeutic reading modules. Which are: "+linebreak+" Phono-Graphix Reading Method: This is a straightforward reading and spelling method, which was developed by Carmen and Geoffrey Mc Guinness in 1993, at the Read America clinic in Orlando, Florida.

Our reading methodâ€™s approach is to teach reading alongside spelling and writing, it is such simplified to cater for the mental capacity of every child. Another module is our Literacy Solution Our cognitive literacy art program is fully gamified and shown to accelerate the acquisition of literacy skills; from phonics, to spelling, to grammar, to reading, to writing and comprehension. From beginning readers to secondary school learners, the program contains thousands of exercises to build literacy skills quickly and enjoyably.",
